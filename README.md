## Release History

* 0.1.0 Initial release

## Disclaimer

All of the characters listed above can be used to break out of an unquoted HTML attribute value. Even if you escape all of them, youâ€™re still a subject to potential attacks. It boils down to a matter of context. This module doesn't cover cases like inserting user input into the body of an inline <script> tag, for example.
